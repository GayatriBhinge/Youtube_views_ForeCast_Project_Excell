# Excell Project | Youtube Views Forecast Data with Graphs

This is biggner level project to analyze the youtube channel viewers database. Here I forcast data for next 7 days with help of the Excell skill, also try to provide  more accurate forecasting using R square value and different graphs, like, Line, Polynomial, exponential graph.
